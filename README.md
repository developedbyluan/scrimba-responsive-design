## Units

### Absolute unit:

-   the same size no matter what size of the screen you view.

### Relative units:

-   Relative to another value (font-size, parent size)
-   Dynamic flexibility
-   Resize & scale

#### Percentage: (for width) relative to the width of the parent element

-   commit: `0e1e4cd``
-   When building responsive layouts, use percentage-based widths to make elements adapt relative to their parent
    containers.
-   In this commit, the .container takes up 90% of the header's width, while the header itself spans 100% of the
    viewport width.
